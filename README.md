# FastAPI, React, SQLlite CRUD Template
This repository is designed as a template for anyone who wishes to build full-stack applications using FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, SQLite for the database, and Docker for containerization. It's a versatile, lightweight, and powerful stack that I've used for both personal projects and internal company applications.

## Why I Chose This Stack
- FastAPI: Fast, modern, and asynchronous framework for building APIs with Python.
- React: One of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.
- SQLite: A simple, lightweight database engine that's perfect for small to medium-sized applications.
- Tabler: A free and open-source web application UI kit based on Bootstrap 5, with hundreds of responsive components and multiple layouts.
- Docker: Easy setup and deployment across different environments, ensuring that "it works on my machine" for everyone.
