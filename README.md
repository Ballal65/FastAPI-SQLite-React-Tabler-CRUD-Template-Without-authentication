# FastAPI, React, SQLite CRUD Template
This repository is designed as a template for anyone who wishes to build full-stack applications using FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, SQLite for the database, and Docker for containerization. It's a versatile, lightweight, and powerful stack that I've used for both personal projects and internal company applications.

## Why I Chose This Stack
- FastAPI: Fast, modern, and asynchronous framework for building APIs with Python.
- React: One of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.
- SQLite: A simple, lightweight database engine perfect for small to medium-sized applications.
- Tabler: A free and open-source web application UI kit based on Bootstrap 5, with hundreds of responsive components and multiple layouts.
- Docker: Easy setup and deployment across different environments, ensuring that "it works on my machine" for everyone.

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the project architecture:

# Backend
## Folder Structure
```
|- backend
|--- app
|------ __init__.py
|------ database.py   # Creating SQLite engine, Base, SessionLocal
|------ main.py       # FastAPI application entry point
|------ models.py     # SQLAlchemy models
|--- routers
|------ __init__.py
|------ vendors.py    # CRUD router for managing vendors
|--- data
|------ sql_app.db    # SQLite database file
|--- dockerfile       # Dockerfile for containerizing the FastAPI app
|--- requirements.txt # Python dependencies for the project
```
## Backend Important files
- database.py: Contains the configuration for the SQLite database and SQLAlchemy engine. It also defines SessionLocal for database session management and Base for model definitions.

- main.py: The main entry point for the FastAPI app, where the API routes are defined and FastAPI is initialized.

- models.py: Defines the database models using SQLAlchemy, which are the structure of the tables in the SQLite database.

- vendors.py: Contains CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the Vendor resource using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. Pydantic models are used for input validation.

- sql_app.db: The SQLite database file where all data for the project is stored.

- dockerfile: Defines how to containerize the FastAPI application using Docker.

# Frontend
## Folder Structure
```
|- Frontend
|--- package.json
|--- package-lock.json
|--- dockerfile
!--- src
|------ app.js             # App Routes
|------ index.js           # The entry point of a React application
|------ pages
|--------- Dashboard.js    # Vendors Page
|--------- Example.js      # Sample empty Page
|------ components
|--------- ConfirmModal.js # Modal to confirm vendor delete
|--------- VendorModal.js  # Modal to create or edit vendor
|--------- VendorTable.js  # Simple vendors table with CRUD buttons
|--- public
|------ index.html         # Created to include Tabler css
|------ dist               # Tabler assets
|------ static             # Table assets
|------ favicon            # Different favicon files
```

## Description 
The screenshot shows Dashboard.js, which uses VendorTable.js to display the table. When you click Add Vendor, the VendorModal.js modal shows up, which is used to create a vendor. The same modal is used to edit the selected vendor. ConfirmModal.js modal opens when you click the delete button for a vendor. I haven't added pagination yet. 
Ignore the header. It is a sample header that we can use for other projects. The header shows the favicon from the public/favicon folder. The HTML code written in the front end is based on the Tabler theme. To learn more about tabler visit `https://tabler.io/admin-template`

# How to use this template
## With Docker
Running the app with Docker is straightforward. You must start your Docker engine and execute this command in the root folder. The command will create containers using the docker-compose.yml file and Docker files from the frontend and backend folders. 
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Without Docker
### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder, you will need to create a virtual environment with 
```
python -m venv venv
```
2. Install all dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Go to the `backend/app` folder and start your application. You can add one argument, 'True' or 'False', to specify the reload state. By default, it is false.
```
python main.py (True/False)
```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder. Install dependencies.
 ```
npm install
 ```
2. Start the app.
```
npm start
```
# Database mount
I love working with SQLite db for smaller or personal applications. The database is safe even if you destroy the docker container as we are using docker volume. A Docker volume is a storage mechanism in Docker that allows containers to persist data, share data between containers, or access data on the host filesystem. You can find the SQLite db `sql_app.db` file in the `backend/data`.
